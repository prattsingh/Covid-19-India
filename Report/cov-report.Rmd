## COVID-19 INDIA

This is a detailed data analysis of Covid-19 Data in india ,
Aiming to extract insights on variables effecting State-Wise performace in combating the pandemic 
and reaching factual conclusions supported by data .


The Data Used was obtained from the following links :<br />
Covid-19 India Dataset - <https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india?select=covid_19_india.csv><br />
India shp file - <https://codeload.github.com/arka1985/MAP_INDIA_R/zip/master><br />
Indian Rural Population - <https://hetv.org/india/india-rural-urban-distribution-of-population-2011.xls><br />

<span style="color: orange;">**The plots reveal that most states in India seem to be performing well against COVID-19 but tests performed by these states reveal that due to lack of testing , there is a lack data to map the spread of disease in such states **</span>
<span style="color: orange;">**Whereas states such as**</span> <span style="color: red;">**Delhi , Arunanchal Pradesh and Goa **</span> 
<span style="color: orange;">**seem to be worst hit by the pandemic only to reveal that these states have performed the most tests per million and thus have a greater grip on the spread of the pandemic inside the states**</span>

# Population Density of Each State


```{r ,, echo=FALSE , out.width='70%' , out.height= '90%'}
load("rda/pop.density.rda")
DT::datatable(pop.density , class = "cell-border stripe" , rownames = F , filter = "top" ,
              editable = TRUE)


```

<br />

```{r fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="POPULATION DENSITY", out.width = '60%' , out.height='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/combined.png")
```


<span style="color: orange;">**Population Density**</span> 
<span style="color: red;">**does not seem to have a major pattern in the performance of states against the pandemic**</span> 
<span style="color: orange;">**as seen states having comparatively lower density are mostly at the bottom left corner of the plot with some towards the top right , Similarly Denser states are also spread allover the graph **</span>

# Rural Density Of Each State


```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%' , out.height='90%'}
load("rda/rural_urban.rda")
DT::datatable(rural_urban , class = "cell-border stripe" , rownames = F , filter = "top" ,
              editable = TRUE)


```
<br />

```{r fig3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RURAL DENSITY", out.width = '60%' ,out.height='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/combined_rural.plot.png")
```


<span style="color: orange;">**The plot reveals a clear pattern showing the significant effect of rural population on each state's performance against the pandemic , with states with higher rural proportion residing mostly towards the bottom left whereas urban states are towards the top right**<br /></span>
<span style="color: green;">**Though the plot also suggests that there are outliers such as Arunanchal Pradesh , Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Andhra Pradesh which are performing relatively better despite higher rural population  **<br /></span>
<span style="color: red;">**Similarly States such as Chandigarh , Kerala and Maharashtra are relatively in worse position despite being mostly urban**<br /></span>

<br />
```{r fig4, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/testing.plot.png")
```
<br />


## CONCLUSION

Most states in India have improved their overall testing per million<br />

<span style="color: red;">**Yet**</span> 
some states have performed significantly better than others while some have done worse ,<br /> 

This goes to show that although their are multiple varibales which effect the performance of a region against a pandemic their is a significant scope for
<span style="color: green;"> **good management and bad management** </span> by respective state governance and authorities.
